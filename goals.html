              Learn Frameworks: In the next few months, my goal is to become
              proficient in a specific front-end or back-end framework. I plan
              to explore React for front-end development or Node.js for back-end
              development.

              Attend Workshops/Conferences: Over the next couple of years, I
              plan to attend industry conferences, workshops, and meetups to
              expand my knowledge, network with professionals, and stay
              up-to-date with the latest trends in software development.

              Lead Development Teams: In the next few years, I aspire to take on
              a leadership role, possibly as a technical lead or a development
              manager. I want to guide and mentor junior developers, make
              architectural decisions, and contribute to the overall growth of
              the team.

              Build Full Project: Over the next year, my goal is to lead the
              development of a full-stack project from start to finish. This
              project will involve both front-end and back-end work, giving me a
              deeper understanding of the complete development cycle.

              Code Review Mastery: I aim to actively participate in code reviews
              and learn from the feedback provided by more experienced
              developers. By the end of this period, I want to confidently
              address issues raised in reviews and write cleaner, more
              maintainable code.

              Improve Algorithm Skills: In the coming months, I want to invest
              time in enhancing my algorithm and data structure skills. I aim to
              solve more complex coding challenges and contribute to open-source
              projects that require these skills.

              Contribute to Open Source: Over the long term, I aim to become a
              recognized contributor to open-source projects. I want to
              collaborate on meaningful projects, share my expertise, and give
              back to the developer community.

              Expand Language Skills: I plan to learn a new programming language
              that is relevant to the tech stack of the company I work for. This
              could be a language commonly used in the industry.

              Specialize or Become a Full-Stack Expert: In the coming years, I

              whether it's front-end technologies, back-end systems, or a
              particular domain like machine learning or cybersecurity.
              Alternatively, I may choose to become a well-rounded full-stack
              expert.
